# My Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website showing my projects that i am currently working on or scheduled to create in the near future.

## General info

This website was created using HTML and CSS. The main structure for the layout is based on Flexbox and was created with a mobile-first approach. The responsive functionality is done with media queries and the standard HTML lists bullets and Social Media bullets have been styled using fonts from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com).

The **Main** section of the website includes all of my upcoming projects. This part of the website is designed as a card based layout inside a Flexbox container.

> **Note:** These projects are not deployed to a live environment yet as they are in the plannig stages.

The **About, Skills, and Contact** information are displayed below. This section also uses Flexbox and utilizes FontAwsome fonts to style the list items so they show images that represent the category of the skill.
